Basically we have to put accurate values for each value in the SampleMecanumDrive in the Roadrunner code library. So anytime we change motors we need to change the velocity the max_velocity_value and the same for both accel. value. And we have to weigh the robot at the end and that stuff. 















We also have to update the motors file for it all. Once all thats done then you have to measure values. Even tho its in Inches it might not be all accurate. Alsoways measure and convert using a multiplier. In the code if u put 50 inches and it goes 30 then do the 50/30 calculation and multiply/divide by the actual distance u want it to go. This code will change.
